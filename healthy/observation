In the auto correlation it appears that the number of points above a certain threshold (in here it is 1) is much larger than that of a normal person.

I suggest putting a certain threshold in the autocorrelation value above which the number of points is proportional to the Atrial Fibrillation of the person.

The measure is implemented in the last part of the code with a comment showing it.
